# Free Code Camp RESTful API Projects

I wrote these microservices as part of the FreeCodeCamp cirriculum.
Originally, these APIs each had their own workspace on Cloud9,
so I refactored them into a single workspace.

I plan to provide an HTML doc at each '/' endpoint, describing
how to use the API.

## The Projects

1. Timestamp Microservice
  - User Story: I can pass a string as a parameter, and it will
    check to see whether that string contains either a unix timestamp
    or a natural language date (example: January 1, 2016).
  - User Story: If it does, it returns both the Unix timestamp and
    the natural language form of that date.
  - User Story: If it does not contain a date or Unix timestamp,
    it returns null for those properties.
